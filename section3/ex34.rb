# Study Drills

# 1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers,
# can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010
# and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.

# Much like above, it's 'the first day in 2010'. I guess that would make 2010 like the array.

# 2. Write some more arrays and work out similar indexes
# until you can translate them.

pizza_toppings = ['pepperoni', 'onions', 'peppers', 'olives', 'anchovies']

# The topping at 2, peppers
# The third topping, peppers
# The topping at 0, pepperoni
# The fifth topping, anchovies

# 3. Use Ruby to check your answers.
